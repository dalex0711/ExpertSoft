## üñß ERM
The **Entity-Relationship Model (ERM)** of the system is composed of key entities that represent the core financial data flow:  

- **Customers**: Stores client details such as name, identification, address, contact information, and email.  
- **Transactions**: Records all movements, including date, amount, type, status, associated customer, platform, and related invoice.  
- **Transaction Types**: Classifies transactions (e.g., deposits, withdrawals, payments).  
- **Transaction Status**: Indicates the current state of the transaction (e.g., completed, pending, failed).  
- **Platforms**: Contains the Fintech platforms used, such as **Nequi** and **Daviplata**.  
- **Invoices**: Stores billing data including invoice number, billing period, amounts billed, and amounts paid.  

These entities are interconnected through primary and foreign keys, enabling a relational structure that supports secure storage, prevents redundancy, and facilitates complex queries.
